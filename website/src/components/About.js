                I'm Annie, a â€˜24 at Dartmouth College studying Computer Science with a minor in Studio Art. 
                As a visual artist, designer, and computer science student, my passions lie in the intersection of design and technology. 
                From painting to coding scripts and designing mobile applications, I love to use problem solving and visual analysis to create delightful, impactful, and humane creations.

                I'm from Shanghai, China (my favorite place in the world) but have also lived in upstate NY, Singapore, and Hanover, NH.
